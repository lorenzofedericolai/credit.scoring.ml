## Overview

This project implements and compares multiple machine learning classification models for **credit default prediction**, translating the theoretical framework of my bachelor's thesis into working code.

The methodology is grounded in:
- **Banca d'Italia Occasional Paper No. 721** (2022) — *Intelligenza artificiale nel credit scoring*
- **Banca d'Italia Occasional Paper No. 674** (2022) — *Explainable Artificial Intelligence*
- **EBA guidelines** on AI governance in credit risk assessment
- **Alonso & Carbò (2020)** — ML accuracy improvements of 2–10pp over traditional econometric models

## Models Implemented

| Model | Type | Explainability | Notes |
|-------|------|----------------|-------|
| **Logistic Regression** | Linear | ★★★★★ | Baseline econometric model (traditional approach) |
| **Decision Tree** | Non-linear | ★★★★☆ | High explainability — preferred by regulators |
| **Random Forest** | Ensemble (Bagging) | ★★★☆☆ | Best accuracy–explainability trade-off |
| **Gradient Boosting** | Ensemble (Boosting) | ★★☆☆☆ | Highest predictive power |

Ensemble methods reflect the industry trend documented in the Banca d'Italia paper: most real-world credit scoring models use **gradient boosting trees** as they balance accuracy and partial explainability through post-hoc techniques.

## Explainable AI (XAI)

The project implements **feature importance analysis** as a proxy for Shapley values, consistent with the XAI methodology discussed in the thesis (Section 3.3).

> *"The Shapley value is inspired by game theory and helps us understand the marginal contribution of each variable to the final prediction."*

This approach aligns with EBA requirements that credit scoring models must:
- Be understandable in their operation
- Include governance systems to prevent bias
- Produce verifiable and documented outputs

## Fairness Analysis

Section 2.4 of the thesis discusses cognitive biases in credit scoring, citing a **Journal of Financial Economics** study showing that minority borrowers faced 14% higher rejection rates and 8% higher interest rates despite identical credit profiles.

This project includes a **statistical parity analysis** across:
- Gender groups
- Education levels
- Age cohorts

## Results

| Model | AUC | CV AUC | Recall (default) |
|-------|-----|--------|-----------------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.630 | 0.624 ± 0.009 | 0.572 |
| Random Forest | 0.628 | 0.625 ± 0.009 | 0.418 |
| Gradient Boosting | 0.618 | 0.618 ± 0.009 | 0.015 |
| Decision Tree | 0.601 | 0.603 ± 0.010 | 0.544 |

> **Note:** Results shown are on synthetic data (UCI-compatible schema). Running with the real [UCI Default of Credit Card Clients dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/350/default+of+credit+card+clients) typically yields AUC of 0.76–0.82 for Random Forest.
